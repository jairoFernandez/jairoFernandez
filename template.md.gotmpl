## Hello! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm [Jairo Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jairofernandezvega/), I'm a Colombian 🇨🇴 and a Fullstack Developer working at [Konstruct](https://konstruct.io). I work mostly with Nodejs and Kubernetes in my day-to-day, and as such, you'll see a few tools below I've built over time to solve *personal itches*. If any of the applications you see are valuable to you or have any feedback, please do not hesitate to create an issue in their respective repository, or message me on Twitter: [@jairoAFernandez](https://x.com/jairoAFernandez). I'm always looking forward to feedback!

### 🚀 Tools I Use Daily

*These are the projects I've built that I actually use every single day - they solve real problems and make my workflow smoother.*

#### [FNPM](https://fnpm-docs.vercel.app/) - End the Package Manager Wars
**The peace treaty for npm vs yarn vs pnpm drama.** Let your team use their favorite package manager while keeping projects consistent. Features transparent aliases, unified lock files, and zero learning curve.

- 📦 **What it does**: Allows teams to use different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) while maintaining consistency
- 🎯 **Why I built it**: Tired of package manager conflicts and lock file drama in team projects
- ⚡ **Daily use**: Every project setup and dependency management
- 🔗 [Documentation](https://fnpm-docs.vercel.app/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ideascoldigital/fnpm)

#### [CLI Maker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ideascol/cli-maker) - Build CLIs Without the Mess
**Rapid CLI development tool that actually works.** Skip the boilerplate and focus on your CLI logic with built-in argument parsing, help generation, and modern tooling support.

- 🛠️ **What it does**: Streamlines CLI application development with templates and utilities
- 🎯 **Why I built it**: Creating CLIs shouldn't be harder than the problem they solve
- ⚡ **Daily use**: Prototyping tools and automating repetitive tasks
- 🔗 [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ideascol/cli-maker) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ideascoldigital/cli-maker)
